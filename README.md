<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is a python application that generates  randomly ordered quiz files. The project was made with teachers/tutors in mind, it is used when a teacher wants to administer a test on capital cities for a continent or for all countries, since the teacher wants to mitigate the risk of students cheationg on the test the program helps because each test paper will be randomly ordered so making it harder for the students to cheat off each others test. The user just has to open the program then answer a few questions such as how many students they plan to test, whether the user wants to generate a quiz files for all the countries or for a specific continent, the user then selects a location on their computer to store the files, finally the program will create a folder on the location specified with two subfolders, one sub folder for all the test quiz files in .txt format and the second sub folder with all the corresponding answer files for each question file.
